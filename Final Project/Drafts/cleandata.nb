Cell[BoxData["\<\", Fla. \[LongDash] President Barack Obama on Wednesday paid \
his first visit to the Everglades to deliver an Earth Day speech. He spoke \
about the threat of rising seas at the endangered national park and the risk \
of climate change across the nation.\\n\\nut his choice of South Florida \
clearly had a political reason, as well. Voters will elect Obama's successor \
in 18 months, and the Republican candidates for president, including one from \
Florida, question whether climate change is man-made. They have taken this \
position despite significant scientific research concluding that climate \
change is mainly caused by pollution from fossil fuels like oil.\\n\\nn a \
speech delivered at Everglades National Park, the president also got a subtle \
dig in at Florida Governor Rick Scott, who has come under fire after he \
ordered state workers to avoid using the term \\\"climate change.\\\"\\n\\n\\\
\"Climate change can no longer be denied \[Ellipsis] cannot be edited out of \
the conversation,\\\" Obama said. The Republican governor, who declined an \
invitation to join Obama on his Everglades tour, has denied that state \
workers are forbidden to use the term.\\n\\n## The River Of Grass\\n\\nefore \
his speech, the president and park rangers walked the Anhinga Trail, the \
park's most popular tourist stop. They passed baby alligators, sleek \
cormorants and a pair of black vultures, which are famous for occasionally \
eating the rubber off visitors' vehicles.\\n\\nbama said he could think of \\\
\"no better place\\\" to spend Earth Day than the River of Grass, as the \
Everglades is called. He praised the virtues of the Everglades, remarking \
that it provides a habitat for both alligators and crocodiles.\\n\\n\\\"I'm \
told this is a good thing,\\\" he joked.\\n\\nhe president was also in South \
Florida to speak about his administration's record on tackling environmental \
problems. Most notably, it has limited carbon emissions, the pollution many \
scientists say causes climate change, and spent $2.2 billion on projects to \
restore the Everglades.\\n\\nbama was expected to reveal new conservation \
efforts in four areas of the country, including Southwest Florida. And in a \
move some say is long overdue, the National Park Service will designate \
Marjory Stoneman Douglas' cottage in Florida as a national monument. Douglas \
is a pioneering preservationist whose book, \\\"Everglades: River of Grass,\\\
\" inspired restoration efforts.\\n\\n## In Senator Rubio's \
\\\"Backyard\\\"\\n\\nbama's decision to focus on climate change in South \
Florida also could have implications on the presidential campaign. It could \
pressure Republicans to debate the subject, which is a touchy one for the \
Republican Party. Among the climate-change skeptics is presidential candidate \
Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. A trip to Rubio's backyard to warn \
about climate change will hardly go unnoticed in the early days of the 2016 \
campaign.\\n\\n\\\"This is not an effort necessarily to go to anybody's home \
state,\\\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday. \
\\\"The truth is those Republicans that choose to deny the reality of climate \
change, they do that to the detriment of the people that they're elected to \
represent,\\\" Earnest said.\\n\\novernor Scott on Tuesday called on the \
federal government to speed up funding to Everglades restoration projects. \
The White House admits that the government has owed the project money since \
even before Obama took office. The state has invested $1.9 billion in the \
Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project, nearly a billion dollars more \
than the federal government.\\n\\ncott said in a statement that Obama must \
find a way to give Florida the $58 million the government still owes.\\n\\n\\\
\"President Obama needs to live up to his commitment on the Everglades,\\\" \
Scott said. \\\"This has caused critical maintenance delays in the Everglades \
to linger for over a year.\\\"\\n\\n## Slow Death Of The \
Everglades?\\n\\narnest suggested that Scott make the funding request to the \
Republican-controlled Congress. He said the governor's criticism was over the \
top given that Scott's government is avoiding even the use of the term \
\\\"climate change.\\\"\\n\\nbama's visit comes at a critical time for \
Everglades restoration, which has dragged on for nearly 15 years.\\n\\nast \
November, Florida voters overwhelmingly to buy land for restoration projects. \
Yet state lawmakers balked at using the money to buy about 46,000 \
acres.\\n\\nestoration work is also becoming more critical as the rising seas \
begin taking a toll on the wetlands. This week, scores of scientists revealed \
new research that showed even more dramatic changes caused by climate change \
could occur in the future. A United Nations group predicts increases in \
temperature, sea level and ocean salinity.\\n\\nangrove forests, which \
provide protection against extreme storms and floods in the Everglades, could \
disappear, studies found. The soil will become more salty, which would allow \
the ocean to flood the Everglades, shrinking it. The wetlands of the \
Everglades, which provides much of South Florida's freshwater, are already \
half their original size.\\n\\n\\\"We're at this key moment where there's \
crucial public recognition\\\" of the effects of global warming, said Florida \
International University ecologist Evelyn Gaiser, who has been invited to \
meet with Obama after his speech. She said awareness of the slow death of the \
Everglades could be a model for other natural areas endangered by climate \
change around the world.\"\>"], "Output",
